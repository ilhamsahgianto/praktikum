Being a Collection subtype all methods in the Collection interface are also available in the Queue interface. 

Since Queue is an interface you need to instantiate a concrete implementation of the interface in order to use it. You can choose between the following Queue implementations in the Java Collections API: 

- java.util.LinkedList
LinkedList is a pretty standard queue implementation.

- java.util.PriorityQueue
PriorityQueue stores its elements internally according to their natural order (if they implement Comparable), or according to a Comparator passed to the PriorityQueue. 

Here are a few examples of how to create a Queue instance:

|-------------------------------------|

| Queue queueA = new LinkedList();    |             

| Queue queueB = new PriorityQueue(); | 

|-------------------------------------|
